            <p>Recycling Electrical and electronic products - what you need to know<br />
	  	  From 1 July 2007, new government regulations called the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations came into force to encourage 			people to arrange collections or recycling of old electrical products, rather than throwing them away.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Why should waste Electrical goods be recycled?</strong><br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Recycling unwanted Electrical products is better 		
          for the environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: How can I recycle my old electrical and electronic products?</strong><br />
			  <strong>A:</strong> Russell Hobbs Limited are offering a no charge take back, all you have to do is buy a similar appliance from one of our 
              websites and we will accept back from you your old appliance and recycle this for you without charge. We do not operate a home collection 
	    	  service but you can send your old appliance back to us when you order a new one from one of our websites. We will then arrange for it to be 	
          recycled.</p>
              <p>Our address for recycling is "WEEE Recycling Department, Customer Services, Spectrum Brands (UK) Limited, Heathmill Road, Wombourne, Wolverhampton 		
          WV5 8AQ or WEEE Recycling Department, Customer Services, Spectrum Brands (UK) Limited, Fir Street, Failsworth, Manchester M35 0HS.</p>
              <p>If it is not convenient for you to return your appliance to either of the above sites you can ring us on 0845 658 9700 and we will send you 	
      a pre-paid label enabling you to return it to us.</p>
              <p><strong>Q: How will I know whether the new product I buy can be recycled?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> All new electrial and electronic 			  products sold now carry the 'crossed out wheelie bin" logo to help you identify which products are recyclable.</p>
              <p>To avoid environmental and health problems due to hazardous waste substances in electrical and electronic goods, appliances marked with this 			symbol mustn't be disposed of with unsorted municipal waste, but recovered, reused or recycled using an official recovery system.</p>
              <p><strong>Q: What we do with your old appliance?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> We will arrange for it to be sent to a specialist recycling
          centre who will recover as much as possible of your old appliance to be recycled and reused.</p>
               <p>For more information about recycling your old appliances please contact our customer services department on 0845 658 9700 or email us direct at <a href="malto:service@russellhobbs.com">service@russellhobbs.com</a></p>
