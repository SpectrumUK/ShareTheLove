		<p>From 1 July 2007, new government regulations called the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations came into force to encourage people to arrange collections or recycling of old electrical products, rather than throwing them away.</p>

<h2>Why is recycling electrical goods important?</h2>
<p>Recycling unwanted Electrical products is better for the environment. Electronic devices and batteries, rechargeable or not, should not be disposed of into ordinary household waste. Instead, they should be recycled properly to protect the environment and also to cut down the waste of precious resources.</p>

<h2>How can I recycle my old electrical products?</h2>
<p>Your city council and waste management authority will be able to inform and advise you about recycling in your area.</p>
