<div class="faq-text">
<h4>Can I heat up other liquids than water in my kettle?</h4>
<p>No, the kettle is intended for heating water only. Do not use it to heat up any other liquids.</p>
<h4>Why does the noise of the kettle increase as the kettle comes to boil?</h4>
<p>The water in this kettle is heated up rapidly, which causes the noise. This is a normal phenomenon and there is nothing wrong with your kettle.</p>
<h4>How can I clean the outside of the kettle?</h4>
<p>Clean the outside of the kettle and the base with a warm damp soft cloth. Do not let the moist cloth come into contact with the cord, the plug and the connector of the base.</p>
<p>Never immerse the kettle or its base in water and do not use abrasive cleaning agents such as scourers to clean the kettle.</p>
<h4>What are the white spots on the bottom of my kettle?</h4>
<p>Depending on the hardness of the water where you live, small spots may appear on the heating element of your kettle when you use it. This is the result of scale build-up on the heating element and on the inside of the kettle over time.</p>
<p>The harder the water, the faster scale builds up. Scale can occur in different colours and although scale is harmless, too much scale can influence the performance of your kettle. Descale your kettle regularly to pro long the life of your kettle.</p>
<h4>Can I clean my anti-scale filter in the dishwasher?</h4>
<p>We don't recommend that you clean your anti-scale filter in a dishwasher as this could cause damage. To clean your filter rinse the filter under a running tap whilst brushing with a soft brush.</p>
<h4>Can I use the kettle without the anti-scale filter?</h4>
<p>We recommend that you don't use the kettle without fitting the filter as the kettle may not switch off automaticaly if the filter isn't fitted. Scale may also give your drink a powdery taste.</p>
<p>The scale filter prevents scale particles from ending up in your drink and has a mesh that attracts scale from the water. Scale is not harmful to your health.
Removing the scale filter can also reduce the performance of your kettle.</p>
<h4>Do I need to descale my kettle?</h4>
<p>Yes, you have to descale your kettle regularly. Minerals present in tap water will cause scale to build up inside your kettle when water is heated.</p>
<p>Regularly descaling your kettle will help to: reduce the boiling time and save energy, keep the inside of the kettle clean and extend the kettles life.</p>
<p>Regular descaling prolongs the life of the kettle. We recommend that you descale regularly - at least monthly.</p>
<p>You must only use a descaler that is suitable for use in plastic products. If you use a descaling agent, follow the instructions on the bottle or package to descale your kettle.</p>
<h4>The kettle doesn't work. What should I do?</h4>
<p>This problem may have multiple causes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The appliance is not connected to the mains.</li>
<li>The dry-boil protection has been activated.</li>
<li>The kettle needs to be descaled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below you can find the solutions for each of these causes.</p>
<p>Solution Cause 1: The appliance is not connected to the mains. 
Check if the plug of the kettle has been inserted properly into the wall socket and if the wall socket is working.</p>
<p>Solution Cause 2: The dry-boil protection has been activated. 
The dry-boil protection is a safety feature that automatically switches off the kettle. It will be activated if the kettle is switched on with insufficient or no water inside or if all of water inside the kettle has evaporated during operation.</p>
<p>To reset the dry-boil protection, you have to lift the kettle from its base and fill it with cold water. When you place the kettle back on the base, the dry-boil protection is reset and you can switch the kettle on again.</p>
<p>Solution Cause 3: The kettle needs to be descaled. Regularly descaling your kettle will help to: reduce the boiling time and save energy, keep the inside of the kettle clean and extend the kettles life.</p>
<p>Regular descaling prolongs the life of the kettle. We recommend that you descale regularly - at least monthly.</p>
<p>You must only use a descaler that is suitable for use in plastic products. If you use a descaling agent, follow the instructions on the bottle or package to descale your kettle.</p>
<p>If the above solution(s) did not help to solve your problem, please contact the Russell Hobbs Consumer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>Why is water ejected from the spout during heating up?</h4>
<p>This indicates that the kettle has been filled beyond the maximum level indication.</p><p>For safety reasons, you should never fill the kettle beyond the MAX indication on your water level indication window.</p>
<h4>There is water/condensation on the base of the kettle. Is this normal?</h4>
<p>If you find some condensation or a few drops of water on the base, this is not a manufacturing defect but a normal occurrence.</p><p>However, if you see more water than just a few drops on the base or under the base, please contact the Russell Hobbs Consumer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>The water boiled in this kettle tastes metallic. How can I improve the taste?</h4>
<p>Try descaling the kettle according to the descale procedure. Rinse carefully afterwards.</p><p>If this does not help, please contact the Russell Hobbs Consumer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>Why does it take a longer time for the water to boil?</h4>
<p>If the water boiling procedure has slowed down, the heating element of the kettle is probably covered with scale. Descale the kettle to remove the scale and revert back to quick boiling.</p>
<h4>How can I descale the kettle and how often should I do this?</h4>
<p>You must only use descaler suitable for use in plastic products. If you use a descaling agent, follow the instructions on the bottle or package to descale your kettle.</p><p>Regular descaling prolongs the life of the kettle. Kettles should be descaled regularly - at least monthly.</p><p>Contact your local or regional water board for information on the hardness of your tap water. If you use the kettle more than 5 times a day, you may have to descale it more often.</p><p>Regularly descaling your kettle will help to pro long the life of your kettle, keep the inside of the kettle clean and reduce boiling times which will then reduce energy consumption.</p>
<h4>Can I throw away my kettle with the normal household waste at the end of its life?</h4>
<p>No, to preserve the environment please hand it in at an official collection point for recycling or you can return to us  and we will recyle it for you.</p><p>Our addresses for recycling is; WEEE Recycling Department, Russell Hobbs Ltd, Heathmill Road, Wombourne, Wolverhampton WV5 8AQ or WEEE Recycling Department, Russell Hobbs Ltd, Fir Street, Failsworth, Manchester, M35 0HS.</p>
<h4>What happens when I accidentally switch on the kettle with no water or not enough water?</h4>
<p>This kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. The kettle will automatically switch off if it is accidentally switched on when there is no water or not enough water in it.</p><p>To use it again lift the kettle from its base and fill it with cold water to reset boil-dry protection. The kettle is now ready for use again.</p>
<h4>The kettle smells weird, how can I remove the smell?</h4>
<p>Try descaling the kettle according the descale procedure, as this removes most smells. Rinse carefully afterwards.</p><p>If this does not help, please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>

<div class="faq-content toasters"><!-- strip image --> <span class="strip-img toasters-strip"></span> <!-- faq text -->
<div class="faq-text">
<h4>How do I cure uneven toasting?</h4>
<p>This can be due to type, thickness or freshness of bread - uneven cut bread will not toast evenly. Also try using different bread type.</p>
<h4>Should the elements glow red?</h4>
<p>On 4-slice models around 95% of the outer elements will glow red after a number of uses but the inner elements will not as they only have half the power of the outer ones.</p>
<h4>Can I cancel my toast at any time?</h4>
<p>Yes you can, just press the cancel button.</p>
<h4>Can I toast bagels or other bread types?</h4>
<p>Yes you can toast bagels (some of our toaster have bagel feature) and other bread types).</p>
<h4>How do I clean my toaster?</h4>
<p>Before cleaning make sure you have unplugged your toaster and let it cool down. Then slide out the crumb tray clean it and then replace and try to do this regularly. Wipe the outside of the toaster with a damp cloth, and then dry.</p>
<h4>What bread can I put in my toaster?</h4>
<p>It is better to use slices of bread. Dry/stale bread toasts more quickly than fresh bread and thinly sliced bread toasts more quickly than thickly sliced bread.</p>
<h4>What does the de-frost button do?</h4>
<p>The toasting time is automatically altered to give you the same degree of browning as you would get with unfrozen bread toasted on the same setting.</p>
<h4>What is a removable crumb tray?</h4>
<p>It is a tray at the bottom of the toaster that collects the loose crumbs - This tray should be regularly removed and cleaned.</p>
<h4>What is browning control?</h4>
<p>The browning control allows you to choose how much you want your bread toasted.</p>
<h4>How do I clean my toaster?</h4>
<p>Before cleaning make sure you have unplugged your toaster and let it cool down. Then slide out the crumb tray clean it and then replace and try to do this regularly. Wipe the outside of the toaster with a damp cloth, and then dry.</p>

<div class="faq-content coffee"><!-- strip image --> <span class="strip-img coffee-strip"></span> <!-- faq text -->
<div class="faq-text">
<h4>Can I throw away my appliance with the normal household waste at the end of its life?</h4>
<p>No, hand it in at an official collection point for recycling. to help preserve the environment. You can also return it to us and we will recyle it for you. Our addresses for recycling are WEEE Recycling Department, Russell Hobbs Ltd, Heathmill Road, Wombourne, Wolverhampton WV5 8AQ or WEEE Recycling Department, Russell Hobbs Ltd, Fir Street, Failsworth, Manchester, M35 0HS.</p>
<h4>How can I clean the outside of the appliance?</h4>
<p>Clean the outside of the coffeemaker with a soft cloth moistened with warm water. Filters, filter holders and carafes can be cleaned in warm soapy water, rinsing thoroughly afterwards to remove all traces of soap. Do not immerse the coffeemaker or its cord in water and do not use abrasive cleaners or scourers to clean the appliance.</p>
<h4>Why does the fuse blow when I switch on the coffeemaker or during use?</h4>
<p>You may have connected too many appliances to the same circuit. Unplug a number of other appliances connected to the same circuit and then plug the coffee maker in again. If the fuse continues to blow, please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>Why doesn't my coffee taste good?</h4>
<p>If the taste of your coffee is not good from the start, please keep in mind that:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should at least brew the minimum amount of coffee as indicated on the jug and water container.</li>
<li>The brand of coffee can influence the taste.</li>
<li>You might want to try a different blend of coffee for a different taste.</li>
<li>Use fresh water to brew your coffee.</li>
<li>Keep your coffee machine clean. Regular cleaning of the filter, holder and jug will have a positive influence on your coffee taste.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the taste of your coffee becomes less after some time of brewing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coffee might have stayed on the hot plate too long. Coffee becomes strong and bitter if you leave it on the hot plate for too long, especially if the jug contains only a small quantity of coffee.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these answers do not solve your problem, please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>Why does my coffee not have the desired strength?</h4>
<p>The amount of ground coffee put in the filter influences the coffee strength. In general, 1 level coffee spoon is enough for 1 small cup of coffee. Depending on your strength preference, you can use less ground coffee for a milder taste and more ground coffee for a stronger taste.</p>
<p>If this solution does not solve your problem you can contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>Why is the coffee not hot enough?</h4>
<p>If you have used the coffeemaker for quite some time and the temperature of the coffee decreases, we advise you to descale the coffeemaker.</p>
<h4>Do I have to descale my appliance?</h4>
<p>Yes. Descaling is an important part of the maintenance of your appliance. You should descale your appliance regularly - at least monthly.</p>
<p>To descale your appliance, you can use any descale agent suitable for use in plastic bodied products or use white vinegar. Do not use cleaning vinegar.</p>
<p>Descaling will take half an hour to an hour to complete. Go through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill the water tank with 0,8 litre of white vinegar or follow the instructions on the package of your descaler.</li>
<li>There is no need to put a paper filter or coffee grind into the appliance.</li>
<li>Switch on the appliance and let it complete one brewing cycle.</li>
<li>Note: For thorough descaling, repeat step 1 to 3 to make sure no scale is left in the appliance.</li>
<li>When using vinegar, let the appliance complete two more cycles with fresh, cold water to remove all vinegar from the appliance. For a descaler, follow the instructions on the package, but at least complete one cycle with fresh, cold water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Descaling your appliance can help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the good quality of your brewed coffee.</li>
<li>Keep the brewing time constant.</li>
<li>Extend the lifetime of your appliance.</li>
<li>Limit the chances your appliance might break down</li>
</ul>
<h4>The coffeemaker continues to drip long after the brewing cycle has ended. Is this normal?</h4>
<p>Some dripping is normal and is caused by condensation of steam, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<h4>There is water/condensation on the lid of the coffeemaker?</h4>
<p>The appliance generates steam during the brewing cycle. Therefore a small amount of condensation on the lid of the coffee maker is normal and does not cause problems.</p>
<h4>Why does the coffeemaker not work after I switch it on?</h4>
<p>If the coffeemaker is not working after you have switched it on, please check if the plug of the coffeemaker is properly inserted in the wall socket and if the wall socket is working.</p>
<p>If this solution does not solve your problem please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>How do I get a more consistent coffee quality?</h4>
<p>Check that the filter holder hasn't fallen. Simply add more coffee to the filter!</p>
<h4>How can I brew hotter coffee?</h4>
<p>Here are some tips to brew hotter coffee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the water heater is working properly: draw off some water from the steam tube. If the water comes out hot, the water heater is OK. If the water is cold, please contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</li>
<li>Check the temperature of the cups. Cold cups will very quickly lower the temperature of the coffee. Try warming cups with some hot water and/or steam or by keeping them on the cup warming plate (if present).</li>
<li>Pre-heat the water circuit and filter by first dispensing one cup of coffee without putting in any coffee, so by dispensing only hot water. After that, start brewing coffee.</li>
</ul>

		<h4>Why does the coffee come out so slowly?</h4>
		<p>Please check the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The coffee you are using may be ground too fine. This stops the water from passing through.</li>
		<li>Only use coffee recommended for espresso machines.</li>

<h3 class="faq-header">Steam Irons</h3>
<!-- sof faq content -->
<div class="faq-content irons"><!-- strip image --> <span class="strip-img irons-strip"></span> <!-- faq text -->
<div class="faq-text">
<h4>My iron doesn't produce any steam.</h4>
<p>Answer 1: The steam control may have been set to the no steam position. Set the steam control to a steam position.</p>
<p>Answer 2: There is no water in the tank and/or the settings are not set correctly.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Step 1: Ensure there is water in the tank.</p>
<p>Step 2: Set to the appropriate steam and temperature setting - When steam ironing, you must set the steam control to steam and the temperature control to a temperature equal to or higher than the steam symbol on the dial.</p>
<h4>The mains power switches off when I switch my iron on or when the iron is in use. Can the appliance cause a power failure?</h4>
<p>Step 1: Check that the connection to the plug is secure and not loose and also check how many appliances are using the same output. Failure could be caused by over current in your mains.</p>
<p>Step 2: Check the iron's power cord for visible signs of damage (e.g. kinks, flaring of the braiding). Remove the rest of the appliances and switch it on again.</p>
<p>Step 3: if the mains power goes off again, contact the Russell Hobbs Customer Service Department on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>The steam boost function or vertical steam boost function on my iron doesn't work.</h4>
<p>Answer 1: The (vertical) steam boost function has been used too often within a very short period.</p>
<p>Put the iron in a horizontal position and wait for a while before using the (vertical) steam boost function again.</p>
<p>Answer 2: The iron is not hot enough. Set the temperature dial to a temperature suitable for steam ironing.</p>
<h4>The Spray function or Spray button on my iron isn't working (properly).</h4>
<p>Make sure there is enough water in the tank and check that the spray button is able to spring back on its own after pressing.</p>
<p>If the spray nozzle hole is blocked, you can clean it carefully with a sharp needle or pin.</p>
<h4>The indicator light isn't working (properly).</h4>
<p>Make sure the iron is plugged into a working mains power and set the temperature dial to a desired position.</p>
<p>It is normal for the orange pilot light to turn on and off during ironing. It comes on as the iron is heating up, and goes off when it is hot enough.</p>
<h4>Smoke comes out of the appliance.</h4>
<p>Some parts of the appliance have been slightly greased and as a result, the appliance may produce some smoke when it is switched on for the first time.</p>
<p>Also, if there is remaining water in the soleplate from the last usage, the smoke observed may actually be water evaporating. However, these will stop after a short while.</p>
<h4>The soleplate coating is scratched/worn away.</h4>
<p>Your iron has multiple thin layers of coating and light scratches will not impede the performance of the iron. You can continue using the iron as per normal.</p>
<h4>My iron leaves shiny patches on fabrics.</h4>
<p>Fabrics can acquire shiny patches if they are ironed at too high temperatures. Try a lower temperature setting.</p>
<p>Also, to prevent shiny patches, you can put a cloth (e.g. a tea towel) between the iron and the fabric.</p>
<h4>What type of water should I use?</h4>
<p>Your appliance has been designed to be used with tap water.</p>
<h4>Water drips from the holes of the soleplate during ironing. What should I do?</h4>
<p>There may be several reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your iron produces a lot of steam. Steam could have condensed on the ironing board cover, making it wet and cause water marks on your garment when the iron is pressed on it.</li>
<li>Ironing aids or fragrance water could have been added to the water tank. This can cause problems with the steaming function, causing water to leak. Use only tap water or distilled water or a mixture of these two types of water.</li>
<li>Steam setting is being used at too low a temperature - The steam function should be switched to "no steam" when using the iron at lower temperatures or the water tank shoud be emptied.</li>
<li>Steam surge/shot/spray being used too rigorously - try using these facilities more slowly.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Water drops appear on the garment during ironing or drip on to the floor.</h4>
<p>The water droplets may appear on the garments when you have steam ironed for a while. This happens because steam has condensed on the ironing board.</p>
<p>Dry the wet spots on the garment and the ironing board cover by passing the iron over them without pressing the steam button. If the underside of the ironing board is wet, wipe it dry.</p>
<p>Make sure you use a mesh-top ironing board with a thick felt material as this minimises steam condensation on the ironing board.</p>
<h4>How can I prevent stains on the soleplate?</h4>
<p>Ironing synthetics at high temperatures can cause staining when synthetic material is scorched.</p>
<p>Synthetics or synthetic-mixed fabrics can only be ironed at the lowest temperature setting.</p>
<p>Always set the temperature acording to the type of clothing being ironed. If unsure, always start with a lower temperature.</p>
<h4>How do I remove the stains on the soleplate?</h4>
<p>To remove a stain, wipe the soleplate with a moist cotton cloth without heating up the iron.</p>
<p>For stubborn stains, soak a cotton rag or pot towel in water &amp; lemon juice, then heat up the iron to 'max' temperature and run the soleplate over the rag.</p>

<h3 class="faq-header">Steam Generators</h3>
<!-- sof faq content -->
<div class="faq-content steam-gen"><!-- strip image --> <span class="strip-img irons-strip"></span> <!-- faq text -->
<div class="faq-text">
<h4>Dirty water and impurities come out of the soleplate during ironing, what should I do?</h4>
<p>Self clean is required or has not been carried out correctly - Refer to the instruction booklet for self clean instructions.</p>
<p>Descaling required (if not a self clean iron) - Descale using a suitable descaler for plastic parts and follow instructions on the packet.</p>
<p>The iron may also require new filter cartridges.</p>
<h4>Is it necessary to empty the water tank after each use?</h4>
<p>Yes, we recommend you always empty the water tank after use and store the iron in an upright position to avoid corrosion and damage to the soleplate.</p>
<h4>The steam generator does not produce any steam. What can I do?</h4>
<p>There is an airlock in the unit - Prime the unit by puting the generator unit on the floor and hold the iron itself up higher. Make sure that you have the heat and steam settings on 'maximum' then keep your finger on the trigger for about 5 &ndash; 6 minutes without letting go and try shaking the wire. This will not damage the unit and we only advise our customers to do this if they have an air lock.</p>
<p>Whilst carrying out the above you will hear the usual pulsating noise as normal, which should go quieter as the shot of steam works its way through the unit.</p>
<p>You can also try to prime the unit the opposite way round by having the generator unit on a high surface holding the iron at a lower level.</p>
<h4>Why does the steam output get weaker?. What should I do?</h4>
<p>It is common for the Steam generator to experience dip in steam pressure/ output when the water is being pumped from water tank to the boiler. This dip is momentarily and it restores to normal rate.</p>
<p>It is also common for the initial burst of steam to be higher and it tapers off to a steady level with continuous triggering of the steam trigger.</p>
<p>This is due to the initial release of build up pressure inside the boiler and this pressure will drop to a steady state level when the steam trigger is continuously depressed. It builds up pressure again when the trigger is released.</p>
<p>If steam output does not recover, kindly check steam generator panel for any notifications and take remedial action. e.g. watertank empty light or steam generator gone into standby mode.</p>
<h4>What type of water should I use?</h4>
<p>Your appliance has been designed to be used with tap water.</p>
<p>In case you live in an area with very hard water, fast scale build-up may occur. Therefore, it is recommended to mix 50% distilled water and 50% tap water, or to use only distilled water to prolong the lifetime of your appliance.</p>
<p>Do not put perfume, vinegar, starch, descaling agents, ironing aids or other chemicals in the water tank, as your appliance is not designed to work with these chemicals.</p>

<h4>The water at home goes through a softener, will this have any affect inside the machine?</h4>
<p>There are different types of water softener, if it is a filter it is OK.</p>
<p>If it is adding chemicals or addicitives into the water, it may damage the Steam Generator and give a poor steam performance.</p>
<h4>Why does the steam generator switch off by itself.</h4>
<p>Some of our irons have an auto-off function which is activated automatically when the steam generator has not been used for around 15 mins.</p>
<p>Press the power on/off button to switch on the steam generator again.</p>
<h4>How to fill/refill water when tank is empty?</h4>
<p>The water tank is detachable. Detach it, and fill the water tank under the tap. You may fill the water tank any time during ironing.</p>
<h4>How to avoid the iron leaving shine/ print on my garment during ironing?</h4>
<p>The likely cause for this is that the garment surface being ironed is uneven; such as pocket or fold line below the garment.</p>
<p>To prevent shine/print, avoid ironing over uneven surface or use a piece of cotton over the surface during ironing.</p>
<h4>What causes the noise in the steam generator when I press the steam trigger? Is this noise normal?</h4>
<p>This noise is caused by movement of the valve that lets steam pass from the steam generator to the iron each time when the steam trigger is pressed. This sound is normal.</p>
<h4>I hear noise coming out of the steam generator during ironing. Is this normal?</h4>
<p>It is normal to hear occasional pumping sounds coming out of the steam generator when water is pumped from the water tank into the steam generator.</p>
<h4>Water droplets appear on the garment during ironing</h4>
<p>The water droplets may appear on the garments when you have steam ironed for a while. This happens because steam has condensed on the ironing board.</p>
<p>Dry the wet spots on the garment and the ironing board cover by passing the iron over them without pressing the steam trigger. If the underside of the ironing board is wet, wipe it dry.</p>
<p>Make sure you use a mesh-top ironing board with a thick felt material. This minimise steam condensation on the ironing board.</p>
<p>When possible, select a lower steam setting or use less steam during ironing.</p>
<p>Use steam ironing during the first few strokes of the iron across the garment, then release the steam trigger and finish up with dry-ironing strokes.</p>
<p>Replace the ironing board cover if the sponge material has worn out. You can also put an extra layer of felt between the ironing board and the ironing board cover to minimise condensation on the ironing board.</p>
<h4>Water droplets come out of the soleplate during ironing, what should I do?</h4>
<p>The droplets are caused by steam that was still present in the hose which has cooled down and condensed into water. This causes water droplets to come out of the soleplate.</p>
<p>To reduce this occurrence, it is recommended Steam away from the garment for a few seconds first.</p>
<h4>How to clear an airlock on a steam generator iron?</h4>
<p>Prime the unit by putting the generator unit on the floor and hold the iron itself up higher. Make sure that you have the heat and steam settings on 'maximum' then keep your finger on the trigger for about 5 &ndash; 6 minutes without letting go and try shaking the wire. This will not damage the unit and we only advise our customers to do this if they have an air lock.</p>
<p>Whilst carrying out the above you will hear the usual pulsating noise as normal, which should go quieter as the shot of steam works its way through the unit.</p>
<p>You can also try to prime the unit the opposite way round by having the generator unit on a high surface holding the iron at a lower level.</p>

<div class="faq-text">
<h4>My Vacuum isn't picking up bits as well as usual.</h4>
<p>To maintain your vacuum machine we recommend that you wash your filter(s) at least once every 3 months and replace once a year.</p>
<h4>Do I need a HEPA filter?</h4>
<p>If you have allergies or asthma, you need a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter so that when you vacuum, you will actually trap microscopic allergens instead of simply stirring them up and polluting the air.</p>
<p>HEPA filters are guaranteed to trap 99.97% of all particles 0.3 microns or smaller. Household allergens are generally one micron to 10 microns in size. For comparison, the diameter of a strand of hair is about 70 microns.</p>
<h4>Do I need a canister vacuum or upright vacuum?</h4>
<p>In general, canister vacuum cleaners are more versatile, lighter, and easier to maneuver. Canister vacuum cleaners also provide smoother transitions between different types of flooring.</p>
<p>Upright vacuums are best suited for homes with carpet in every room.</p>
<h4>Are vacuum cleaners with dust bags better for allergy sufferers?</h4>
<p>The simple answer is "Yes". Vacuum cleaners with dust bags are generally healthier for allergy sufferers because the bag keeps the dust out of the air.</p>
<p>However, not all bags are created equally. Some bags have large pores which allow allergens to escape the bag.</p>
<p>However, as long as care is taken when emptying the dust bin, bagless vacuum cleaners have much to offer allergy sufferers.</p>
<p>If you have allergies and use a bagless vacuum cleaner, we recommend that you empty the dust bin outdoors. We also suggest that you either have someone else empty it for you or wear a mask.</p>
<h4>If a vacuum cleaner has a more powerful motor, does that mean it has more suction power?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. The amperage of a vacuum cleaner's motor measures electrical current, not performance or suction power. The performance of the vacuum cleaner depends on the overall design, the filtration, and the air flow.</p>
<h4>What is the difference between a turbobrush and a powerbrush?</h4>
<p>A turbobrush is air-driven, while a powerbrush is driven by electricity (usually an independent motor in the brush attachment itself).</p>
<h4>How often should I vacuum my home?</h4>
<p>In an ideal world, an area that has heavy traffic should be vacuumed every day. But once or twice a week is more realistic with today's busy lifestyles and certainly enough for areas that aren't often used.</p>
<p>For best results, slowly move the vacuum over the carpet several times, going back and forth and side to side in parallel rows.</p>
<h4>How many passes of a vacuum cleaner does it take to clean carpet?</h4>
<p>Generally, you should use as many as seven strokes for high-traffic areas; three or four for lighter ones.</p>
<h4>What are all the attachments for?</h4>
<p>When you're vacuuming pile carpets and rugs, you should use the turbo brush, but when you're cleaning bare floors and walls, it's best to use the wall/floor brush.</p>
<p>To get dust out of drawers, heating and air-conditioning vents, and from under larger appliances, try the crevice tool.</p>
<p>For mattresses, upholstered fabrics, curtains and car interiors, use the upholstery attachment.</p>
<p>And to remove dust from blinds, lampshades and moldings, use the small brush.</p>
<h4>How often should I change the filter on my vacuum?</h4>
<p>If the filter shows signs of wear, or is excessively dirty or torn, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>HEPA filters - ones that remove most dirt particles - should be changed after six months.</p>
<p>The owner's manual will tell you where the filter is located.</p>
<h4>At what height should my nozzle adjustment be set?</h4>
<p>The level you set your nozzle at depends on the height of your carpet.</p>
<p>For example, you would use the lowest setting for a low-pile carpet and a higher one for plush carpet.</p>
<p>You'll only need to push your vacuum with a moderate amount of effort when you've selected the appropriate level.</p>
<h4>When do I know it's time to replace the belt on my vacuum?</h4>
<p>If you think your vacuum isn't cleaning as well as it used to or the brush roll has stopped turning, it may be time to change your belt.</p>
<p>First, shut off your vacuum and unplug its cord. It's not difficult to replace the belt as long as you have a screwdriver and a replacement belt.</p>
<p>For instructions for your specific vacuum, refer to your owner's manual or call the manufacturer's service center.</p>
<h4>What should I do if my vacuum cleaner isn't picking up dirt?</h4>
<p>First, give it a full inspection. To do so, turn the machine off and unplug it. Then, check to see if the belt is worn or broken, or if the roller-brush won't move. Also, look for a full bag or any blockage that might be affecting the power of the machine.</p>
<p>Sometimes, new carpet can be a problem because it sheds more fiber and has a tendency to fill bags/bins quickly and clog the air stream.</p>
<p>If everything checks out and your machine still isn't working properly, call Russell Hobbs Customer Services on 0845 658 9700.</p>
<h4>How do I vacuum an Oriental rug?</h4>
<p>Since Oriental rugs can be very fragile, you may have to use extra care when vacuuming them.</p>
<p>Still, to keep them in peak condition, they should be cleaned often. If you're using an upright vacuum cleaner, it's best to turn off the agitator brush (if possible). When approaching the fringe, tip up the front slightly and push it completely off the carpet. This cleans the fringe without catching it in the rotating agitator brush.</p>
<p>With a canister vacuum, use the bare floor brush for gentler cleaning of the carpet, and use an upholstery attachment for the fringe.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to periodically turn the rug over so you can vacuum its underside.</p>
<h4>Is it bad for my carpet or vacuum to use powder fresheners</h4>
<p>Provided you have a good vacuum, powders shouldn't be a problem. For the best pick-up, start with a clean bag.</p>
<p>Since these powders can clog the bag, you'll probably have to change the bag afterwards (if using a bagged cleaner).</p>

<div class="faq-text">
<h4>Why does the motor produce an unpleasant smell during processing?</h4>
<p>It is very common for a new appliance to give off an unpleasant smell or emit some smoke the first few times it is used.</p>
<p>This phenomenon will stop after you have used the appliance a number of times. The appliance may also give off an unpleasant smell or emit some smoke if it has been used too long.</p>
<p>In this case you have to switch the appliance off and let it cool down.</p>
<h4>There is foam coming out of the blender. What did I do wrong?</h4>
<p>The quantity you put in the jar was too large. When processing foaming ingredients, do not fill the jar beyond two thirds of its overall capacity.</p>
<h4>What is the function of the small cap?</h4>
<p>During processing, you can remove the cap to add liquid and solid ingredients. Switch the blender off before adding solid ingredients.</p>
<h4>Sometimes liquid ingredients splash out of the jar. What should I do?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Check if the lid is closed properly.</li>
<li>Never open the lid during processing.</li>
<li>To prevent spillage, do not overfill the blender (please refer to the instruction booklet).</li>
<li>When you have switched the appliance off, wait until the blade has stopped turning completely before opening the lid.</li>
<li>Increase the speed of blending gradually, instead of starting the appliance at the highest speed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>All the ingredients stick to the wall of the jar and the blade does not touch them. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Loosen the ingredients with a spatula (switch the appliance off before doing so) or by adding some liquid.</p>
<h4>All the ingredients stick to the wall of the chopper bowl and the blade does not touch them. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Loosen the ingredients with a spatula (switch the appliance off before doing so).</p>
<h4>How long is the processing time for blending?</h4>
<p>It depends on the quantity and the ingredients, however, on average the time for blending is about 30 - 60 seconds.</p>
<h4>Can I pour boiling hot liquids into the blender jar?</h4>
<p>No, to avoid damage to the jar let the liquid cool down to the sort of temperature you can comfortably handle, i.e. liquid temperature below 40&deg;C.</p>
<h4>Can I process hot ingredients?</h4>
<p>Yes, but the ingredients must not be hotter than 40&deg;C.</p>
<h4>What can I do with the blender jar?</h4>
<p>You can use the blender jar for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blending fluids, e.g. dairy products, sauces, fruit juices, soups, mixed drinks, shakes.</li>

<li>Pureeing cooked ingredients, e.g. for making baby food.</li>
<li>Crushing ice cubes (not all models - please check your instruction booklet).</li>
</ul>
<h4>What does 'pulse' mean?</h4>
<p>When you turn the control knob to the pulse setting, the appliance runs at its highest speed as long as you keep the knob in this position.</p>
<p>Use the pulse setting if you want to have more control over the processing jobs.</p>
<h4>How can I add ingredients when the blender is running?</h4>
<p>You can add liquids through the small hole in the lid. When you want to add solid ingredients, switch the blender off first.</p>
<h4>The end result is not fine enough. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Let the appliance run at maximum speed for a longer period of time or use the pulse function (not all models have this) several times.</p>
<h4>Sometimes liquid ingredients splash out of the jar. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Never open the lid during processing. When you have switched the appliance off, wait until the blade has stopped turning completely before opening the lid.</p>
<p>Increase the speed of blending gradually, instead of starting the appliance at the highest speed.</p>
<h4>The blender jar leaks. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Set the control knob to 0 and pour out the ingredients. Make sure that the sealing ring is properly in place on the blade unit.</p>
<p>Also make sure that the blade unit is assembled correctly (on models with removable blade).</p>
<h4>Why does the motor produce an unpleasant smell during processing?</h4>
<p>It is common for a new appliance to give off an unpleasant smell or emit some smoke the first few times it is used.</p>
<p>This phenomenon stops after you have used the appliance a number of times. The appliance may also give off an unpleasant smell or emit some smoke if it has been used too long.</p>
<p>In this case, set the control knob to 0 and let the appliance cool down.</p>
<h4>The appliance stopped running because the blade unit is blocked. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Set the control knob to 0 and use a spatula to dislodge the ingredients that block the blade unit. We also advise you to process a smaller quantity.</p>
<h4>Cleaning the blender jar is a difficult job. What is the easiest way to clean it?</h4>
<p>The easiest way to clean the jar is to fill the jar with 500ml water and some washing-up liquid and turn on for 60 seconds (or press the pulse button several times (if your blender is fitted with one). Rinse the jar afterwards.</p>

<div class="faq-content hand-mixers"><!-- strip image --> <span class="strip-img hand-mixers-strip"></span> <!-- faq text -->
<div class="faq-text">
<h4>What are the different attachments for my hand mixer?</h4>
<p>Hand Mixers always come with the dual beater attachment, meant for the basic jobs of whisking and mixing lighter mixtures such as pastry and creams.</p>
<p>Some Hand Mixers also come with a set of kneading tools as well. These kneading tools are used to stretch and knead heavy doughy mixtures.</p>
<h4>What ingredients can I use with a Hand Mixer?</h4>
<p>Hand Mixers are designed for beating dough and pastry, so they can easily cope with any of the ingredients involved.</p>
<p>They deal well with soft or liquid mixtures, but will not affect solids very much.</p>
<h4>What is a Hand Mixer?</h4>
<p>A Hand Mixer is a handheld appliance used for mixing cake and pastry mixtures.</p>
<p>They are also used for whisking. The double beaters are the main function of a Hand Mixer.</p>
<h4>What recipes can I make with a Hand Mixer?</h4>
<p>Hand Mixers specialise in recipes such as dough and batter mixes.</p>
<p>The way the twin beaters work allows air to be folded into a mixture so it will give a light and fluffy batters, and thin and light creams.</p>
<h4>What speeds are suited to what ingredients?</h4>
<p>Lower speeds are the more commonly used with a hand mixer, their uses ranging from batter to cream, to mixing pastry ingredients.</p>
<p>The higher speeds tend only to be used for lighter, thinner mixtures such as whisked sponge or egg whites, but this should always be reached by gradually increasing the speed, rather than suddenly setting the hand mixer to high.</p>
<h4>How do I clean my hand mixer?</h4>
<h5>Cleaning the attachments</h5>
<p>The simplest way to clean any hand mixer attachments you may be using is to do it as soon as you finish using them. Keep a small, deep container with a small amount of clean water in it close at hand.</p>
<p>When you finish using an attachment, place it in the clean water and let it whirl around two or three times to remove any of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Remove the attachments and lay them to one side. Dampen a soft rag with white vinegar. Wipe down each attachment with the vinegar rag. Allow them to air dry and put them away.</p>
<h5>Cleaning the mixer itself</h5>
<p>Food just loves to get into the attachment ports and around the mixer's buttons. If it is allowed to stay there and harden, it can be quite difficult to remove.</p>
<p>Have a toothpick and an old toothbrush close at hand. Use one or both of these items to remove the accumulated food from these places.</p>
<p>Never immerse your electric kitchen hand mixer in water. It will ruin your mixer. Use a soft cloth dampened with white vinegar to wipe off the outside of the mixer. Dry it immediately.</p>
<h5>Cleaning the cord</h5>
<p>Few people take the time to look at their mixer cord. Make sure your mixer is unplugged before you attempt to clean the cord. Use a soft rag with white vinegar to wipe it clean.</p>
<p>If any spots don't come clean, dampen the spot and scrub it with a toothbrush and a little baking soda.</p>
<p>Learning how to clean your electric kitchen hand mixer is important to keep it running problem-free.</p>
<h4>What is the advantage of a hand mixer?</h4>
<p>It does most of the work for you.</p>
<h4>How do I use dough hooks?</h4>
<p>Dough hook attachments eliminate the need for expensive bread machines or stand mixers. These strange looking hooks can be confusing, and even a bit intimidating if you've never used them before.</p>
<p>The use of dough hooks on a hand mixer is essentially the same as using any other mixer attachments, so the process is easy to pick up as long as you have some experience with hand mixers.</p>
<p>Plug the dough hook attachments into the hand mixer. You simply need to push the attachments into the holes on the bottom of the mixer until they snap into place.</p>
<h4>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a Hand Mixer?</h4>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relatively cheap</li>
<li>Portable</li>
<li>Very easy to use</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not as powerful as stand mixers.</li>
<li>They require you to physically stand and hold the handmixer in your hand for the whole duration of the mixing which can be tiresome and which also means you can't multitask.</li>

<h4>How do I clean my vegetable food steamer?</h4>
<p>To clean the vegetable food steamer, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug cord from outlet. Before cleaning, allow Steamer to cool. Never immerse the Base, Cord or Plug in water.</li>
<li>Empty the drip tray and the water reservoir.</li>
<li>Wash lid, steaming bowl, rice bowl and drip tray in hot, soapy water. Rinse and dry all parts. Do not put any parts in the dishwasher.</li>
<li>Clean reservoir with soapy water then wipe with damp cloth.</li>
<li>Do not use abrasive cleaners.</li>
<li>In hard water areas, the scale may build up in the heating element. If scale is allowed to accumulate, the steam could turn off before the food is cooked. So, after 7 to 10 uses, pour 1pint of clear white vinegar into the water reservoir. Do not place lid, steaming bowl, rice bowl and drip tray in this procedure.</li>
<li>Plug in and set timer to 20 minutes. When the timer rings, unplug cord from outlet. Allow the unit to cool completely before emptying water reservoir. Use cold water to rinse the water reservoir several times. Dry the base unit thoroughly.</li>
</ol>
<h4>When using a vegetable food steamer, what foods go in what basket or how can I cook more than one at a time?</h4>
<p>We make food steamers that come with three steamer bowls. If you are cooking more than one item (potatoes, vegetables, fish), we recommend placing the food that will take longer in the bottom steamer bowl and the others in the middle and top steamer bowl.</p>
<p>For example; potatoes and carrots in the bottom, cabbage, broccoli or cauliflower in the middle and fish at the top.</p>
<h4>Why is the white rice not cooking all the way in my food steamer?</h4>
<p>Most of the time, white rice not cooking all the way is caused from the use of slow cooking rice.</p>
<p>If you are using slow cooking rice, use 1-cup of rice to 1 1/4 cups of water and cook for 35 minutes.</p>

<h4>I am lacto intolerant. (Lactose intolerance is basically an allergy to the sugar, which is found in milk). What substitute can I use for the milk in the recipes?</h4>
<p>Non-Dairy milk products such as soya milk, rice milk etc may be used in equal measures to replace milk in bread recipes. Powdered soya milk or tofu milk powder may also be used instead of non-fat dry milk but you must follow the package instructions.</p>
<p>(Also, equal measures of vegetable cooking water, fruit juices, vegetable juices, flat beer and plain water are all viable substitutions for milk in most recipes but customers would have to experiment with these).</p>
<h4>Loaf is very small / heavy &amp; dense</h4>
<p>Answer 1: Yeast - Is the yeast being used correctly? If it is in a large box, packet or tin it may need to be pre activated with water first (please refer to packaging instructions).</p>
<p>If it is in small sachets then it probably won&rsquo;t need mixing first but please check packaging instructions).</p>
<p>Is the yeast still in date or if in sachet form was it opened more than a day before? If either of these are the case then the yeast will have been inactive and the bread won&rsquo;t have risen.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Correct Programme - Has the correct program and weight setting been keyed into the machine. For example if the ingredients for a 1kg were loaded in and a 500g weight setting chosen then the cycle will have been too short and the bread wouldn&rsquo;t be very risen.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Conditions - Was the bread maker left in a draft or a very cold room? Was the bread maker lid opened during the rising and baking cycle.</p>
<p>Answer 4: Other ingredients - Was sufficient yeast, sugar and water used? Were the ingredients added in the correct order, i.e liquids first, yeast last? If the yeast was in contact with the water too soon then it could become inactive.</p>
<h4>Loaf is sunken on top</h4>
<p>Answer 1: Liquid - Was there too much liquid used? If this happens regularly we would recommend that you start reducing the water down by approximately a dessertspoon at a time until the desired results are achieved.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Other ingredients - Was too much sugar or yeast added? This would cause the bread to over rise and then collapse.</p>
<p>Was there enough salt added? Salt prevents bread from over rising and if insufficient salt was added this can result in a loaf with a sunken top.</p>
<p>Were strong / pungent ingredients used such as garlic or cinnamon? These are not very 'yeast friendly' and so only small amounts should be used. Try slightly reducing the amounts used next time.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Conditions - Was the lid opened during the rising or baking process? Opening the lid would cause the heat to escape making the bread 'dome' collapse.</p>
<p>Was the bread maker moved or knocked whilst operating? This could have disturbed the process and made the bread collapse.</p>
<h4>Bread Surface Is Very Uneven / Knarled &amp; Knotty</h4>
<p>Liquid: Was sufficient liquid added &ndash; Too little and the dough won't form into an even shape. Always check that the dough is forming into a smooth, slightly tacky ball.</p>
<p>If the dry ingredients aren't being picked up then add a few more drops of water as it is mixing.</p>
<h4>Bread Is Soggy Or Too Moist In The Centre</h4>
<ol>
<li>Cutting too soon: Was the bread sliced straight away? The bread should always be allowed to cool and dry out on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes after baking. If it is cut into straight away, the steam escaping will make the bread soggy.</li>
<li>Added ingredients: Were moist ingredients used such as bananas, apple sauce, yogurt? These can make the centre of the bread soggy so we would suggest reducing amount used down by a teaspoon at a time until desired results are achieved.</li>
<li>Humidity: Was it a very humid day? &ndash; Humidity can make dough too moist. If the bread maker is used on a very humid day, we would suggest you add an extra tablespoon of flour to the ingredients.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What is the best yeast to use in the Bread maker?</h4>
<p>Any standard dried yeast is fine. As well as this, you can get the type in a tin or large packet which needs pre-activating with water before use; (Allison's in a tin is an example).</p>
<p>The yeast found in small sachets however is ready to use and does not need mixing with water beforehand (it is 'live' hence being in small amounts).</p>
<p>You also get fast action yeast which is about 3 times more potent than standard dried yeast and so you can use it but you won't need as much.</p>
<p>We don't really advise using fresh yeast, as the results are more unpredictable. Our Home Economist generally recommends Allison's "Easy Bake", which is found in small sachets and is usually available in supermarkets. The results from this yeast are normally very good and it is very easy to use.</p>

<div class="faq-text">
<h4>Can I deep Fry frozen foods?</h4>
<p>Yes. Just remember to shake off any excess ice before frying them.</p>
<h4>Can I re-use the oil from my Deep Fat Fryer?</h4>
<p>Yes, but you should allow the oil to cool, then pour the oil through muslin or absorbent paper before re-using. However oil should be completely changed after every 8-10 uses.</p>
<h4>How do I clean my Fryer?</h4>
<p>Never start cleaning until the oil has cooled down. The basket, bowl and lid should all be removed (Please note that on some models the bowl is not removable) and soaked in hot soapy water for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The basket should then be cleaned with a stiff brush and the bowl with a non-abrasive cleaner. The outer body should be wiped with a damp cloth.</p>
<h4>Why is corn oil recommended for Fryers?</h4>
<p>Other oils may cause foaming and unpleasant smells at higher temperatures. Corn oil will give up to 8-10 uses whereas other oils should be changed after 3-4 fries.</p>
<h4>Why has the food become soft and sticky?</h4>
<p>You should wait until the oil reaches a high enough temperature before frying; the optimum temp is 190&deg;C.</p>
<h4>Why is the oil overflowing during the frying process?</h4>
<p>Answer 1: This usually happens when the oil has been used several times and has a poor quality. The oil should be replaced asap.</p>
<p>Answer 2: Adding watery and refrigerated food materials can lead to this problem.</p>
